Hi [% username %],

You're receiving this email because your username matches a word or phrase that may cause technical, harassment, or security issues, such as preventing you from being able to access certain pages on the site.

For your account's security, and to ensure that you continue to be able to access it, we will need to change your username to a generic name. This will affect how your works, bookmarks, and comments appear on the site, and you will no longer be able to use your current username to log in. You will still be able to log in or request password resets using your email address. We regret the inconvenience.

On DATE, we will be changing your username to [ % new_username %]. If you wish to update your username before this date, you can do so by going to your preferences page (https://archiveofourown.org/users/[% username %]/change_username). Usernames must be between 3-40 characters (A-Z, a-z, _, 0-9 only), and cannot begin or end with an underscore (_).

Please contact AO3 Support (https://archiveofourown.org/support) if you have any further questions.
